# Machine Learning

The machine learning pipeline follows a simple flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A(Events from detector) --> B(Data preparation <br/>& feature engineering)
  B --> C(Model development <br/>& training)
  C --> D(Model evaluation)
  D --> E(Prediction)
```

Events are received from the Python detector frontend program, which formats them into a .csv consisting of a row per event with columns that are the features used for our classifier to base its predictions on.

Based on the events received, the following features can be computed and normalised. This step corresponds to the Data preparation & feature engineering step, which is performed by the dataprep.py program:

  - For each type of event:
    - Average number of events per second;
    - Maximum number of events per second (rate); 
    - Total number of events.
  - For each possible event patterns:
    - Average number of pattern matches per second;
    - Maximum number of patterns matches per second (rate); 
    Total number of pattern matches.
  - Type of files accessed:
    - Sensitive Linux files (e.g., /etc/, /var/, /usr/, /sys/), especially if they are modified or created.

For the next step, we considered simple classifiers like kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and SVM
(Support Vector Machine) with different kernels. SVM works particularly well for our dataset
and purpose, since it is very effective in high-dimensional spaces and relatively memory efficient.

The processed data is split into training and testing data, following a 60/40% split. This means
that the resulting Machine Learning model is validated using data that wasnâ€™t used for training.

When new data is processed through the model, it will assign a label depending on whether it
is classified as ransomware or benign.
