## Overview

This is the final result of an Offensive Technologies research project for the MSc Security and Network Engineering program of the University of Amsterdam. This is not intended to be a final product/solution to use in any productions environment whatsoever, it is simply the byproduct of research and therefore is intended to use as so.

## Software architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph sandbox_VM
    ransomware
  end
  ransomware --> network_hook & filesystem_hooks & crypto_hooks
  subgraph host_kernel
    network_hook & filesystem_hooks & crypto_hooks --> ebpf_c

  end
  subgraph host_userland
    ebpf_c -- events --> ebpf_python
    ebpf_python -- patterns + config --> ebpf_c
    ebpf_python --> machine_learning
  end
```

### eBPF C program

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A(event) --> B(compute stats <br/>per pid)
  B --> C(detect event pattern <br/>and threshold counts)
  X(python) -. patterns + config .-> C
  C --> D{report event?}
  D -- yes --> E(submit event <br/>to ring buffer) -->F(end)
  D -- no --> F
```
